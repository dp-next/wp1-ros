However, there are many modern tools and methods used within industry that research environments and projects could benefit from, such as data engineering, software development, and operations management.\nLikewise, basic modern communication and project management tools are rarely, if ever, used within research environments, even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings.

    "text": "3.2 Specifics of the strategy\nExpanding on the strategies listed on the landing page, the below describes more of the details about the specific strategies from a technical or digital perspective. Many of these activities and strategies will get support and contributions from the Seedcase Project team at Steno Aarhus, who regularly use and refine many of these practices in their work.\n\n3.2.1 Project management\nWhile general project management and coordination will be done by the management group, the technical strategy for the project management will involve applying iterative and incremental methods often used in software development, such as Agile-inspired methods. Practically, this involves:\n\nUsing time-bound “iterations” that has a specific aim to complete, where tasks are assigned that work toward completing this aim. This may involve having iterations be on a monthly basis.\nUsing a (digital) project board to track tasks, their status, who is assigned to what, with issues or discussions connected to each task.\nHaving regular “reflection” meetings to identify things that work and things to improve on in our collaboration and management.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Collaborative practices\nBuilding an effective collaboration between groups, centers, and people requires agreeing to a set of common practices that we all adhere to. In this way, we’ll develop a description of basic standards and practices that we will discuss, refine, and agree on during the first year of the project. These documents will be living documents that we will post publicly on this website. Concretely, some practices may be:\n\nUsing a common set of tools for communication that works for everyone.\nUsing relevant communication channels dependent on the purpose, for example, extended discussions of a specific task should be done where the task is listed.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Research operations\nThe aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. This often integrates software engineering and data engineering work to accomplish the operational task. Concretely, this may include:\n\nAutomatically converting our documentation in easy to share and search websites.\nRegularly and actively seeking out areas of the research lifecycle that can be simplified, streamlined, or automated by incorporating dedicated meetings or reviews to uncover these areas to optimise. Then, based on this information, working to implement a solution.\nIdentifying and documenting the resources, limitations, and barriers on cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes to minimize their impact on the project.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Software development\nResearch output includes more than just papers and presentations. It also includes analytic methods implemented as software packages. When work packages, such as Work Package 2, build or work on an analytic method, we will ensure that work with them to develop the software in a robust, well-designed, reliable, and maintainable way. Concretely, some activities may include:\n\nDeveloping a template for building the software package that includes best practices for software development.\nContributing to data science activities by building reproducible analytic pipelines for faster dissemination of results.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Data engineering\nData engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and building data infrastructures and pipelines that support the collection and storage of high-quality data. Part of the aim of the Seedcase Project is in building software tools to help with creating and managing data and metadata in a way that applies FAIR principles and that simplifies the tasks that researchers have with requesting and working with the data. So the Seedcase team will be heavily involved in these tasks. Concretely, some activities may include:\n\nDeveloping a template for building data pipelines that includes best practices for data engineering.\nAutomating or streamlining data flows, from collected into stored, for rapid internal sharing of data outputs.\nStructuring and designing register data format conversion pipelines into more powerful and modern formats.\nDesigning and building data generated into a functioning and FAIR “data package”.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Knowledge management\nKnowledge management is the practice of capturing, storing, and sharing knowledge across an organisation or group. In the context of this project, we will focus on capturing and sharing knowledge about the project, the knowledge we produce, as well as any research output that we have. We “capture” knowledge largely by using GitHub to write, share, and discuss things, either as issues, comments, or files. Knowledge includes:\n\nInformation about the project, the research, and the tools and practices that we use.\nStudy protocols that are the description of the research question, the methods used to answer the question, and the data that will be collected.\nData management plans, which are the description of how data will be collected, stored, and shared.\nStatistical analysis plans, which are the description of how the data will be analysed.\nOperational documents, like decisions made, procedures, collaboration agreements, and workflows for collaboration and work.\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Technical working group\nTo help facilitate the technical and digital strategies so that they are achievable, we will establish a technical working group. More details about this group is found in the Groups page.\n\n\n3.2.8 Training\nA major component of Work Package 1 is in training and upskilling activities. We will accomplish these by collaborating with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project (4) as well as with the expertise we’ve developed at Steno Aarhus over the years. Training will include both formal and informal activities that focus on skills not often taught to researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices, and iterative project management methods.",

From both the technical and cultural sides, these work tasks often lack support at the institutional level and lack of awareness and training at the personnel level. So usually work is done from the ground-up, which often results in unexpected issues.\nGiven that there are few personnel in research environments with the necessary technical knowledge and skills and they often move out of academia into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we’ve structured the groups to include at least one “tech lead” who is also part of the technical working group is to help minimise this challenge. We aim to provide training to these tech leads by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we’ve decided to establish the technical working group, so that we can minimise the impact these issues have on completing the project deliverables.",

This includes making websites for documentation and practices (as well as publishing it to Zenodo) and developing sharable, reusable code (e.g., R packages).\nContribute to improving and supporting effective collaborative practices within and across Steno Centers and DP-Next.\nSupport in upskilling other members of each tech leads’ respective Steno Center in digitally technical skills, either informally via mentoring or formally by acting as teachers for workshops.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Expectations\nGiven the above responsibilities, we expect that tech leads will:\n\nUse GitHub and Git to create and edit files.\nUse GitHub Issues to track tasks, share progress, and discuss problems.\nAttend regular virtual meetings to discuss challenges, share knowledge, and update on progress.\nUse Discord to communicate with other tech leads and with other members of the project.\nWrite documentation in Markdown as much as possible.\nWhen doing analyses, write code in R or Python, while also implementing reproducible practices.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Benefits\nWhile there will be a bit of extra work for each tech lead, there are also a lot of benefits to being part of this group that over time can help reduce overall work and effort.\n\nSupport in resolving digital and technical challenges, rather than being alone to figure things out.\nBuild a bigger network that will expose the tech leads to future opportunities.\nMore quickly gain new skills and knowledge in a supportive environment with experts and peers, compared to not being part of the group.\nAn emotional support group to share struggles that are outside of our control.\nA direct channel to the group to ask questions and get help more quickly than not being part of the group.\nPotentially produce more academic output than would be possible alone or not in this group (e.g. “best practices for open and reproducible research” type papers or protocols).\nVisible contributions to improving research practices within DP-Next, and for likely across the Steno Centers and even in Denmark.",

In our case, the design patterns we will use are:\n\n7.4.1 One Git or GitHub repository per scientific output\nThe pattern of “one repo, one product” is a widely used pattern in many types of projects. There are many tools, templates, and workflows that are built around this pattern. For instance, it is easier to ensure a scientific document is reproducible if it follows this pattern. So administratively and collaboratively, it is easier to use a pattern like this, since it is a standardized way of structuring work. For DP-Next, this pattern includes the protocols as well as the scientific results.\nSome servers don’t allow internet or easy access to outside resources like GitHub. But all servers have Git installed. In those cases, each scientific output is one Git repository.",

To achieve our reproducibility aim, we need to use tools that are code-based and not GUI-based since GUI-based tools are inherently difficult to make reproducible. Using an open source tool greatly simplifies the process of sharing and reproducing results. But for this decision post, we will compare closed sources tools as well.

The R language is widely used among statisticians and data analysts for developing statistical methods and doing data analysis.\n\n\n\n9.3.1.1 Benefits\n\nWidely used in the research community\nMassive, friendly, and supportive community\nLarge number of packages, that can do nearly any task\nHas all the latest statistical methods that can be installed as packages\nHas a large number of resources and learning material to use (including the DDEA’s R courses that run every year)\nBeginner friendly data analysis tools via the tidyverse\nOpen source, free to use, easy to install\nBecause it is open source, it has more support with AI helper tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot\nHas a lot of templating tools available to simplify many aspects of data analysis work through packages like usethis\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1.2 Drawbacks\n\nCan be difficult to learn, so has a steeper learning curve\nStill not as widely used in the research environment, at least the Danish context, as Stata, so doesn’t have as much institutional support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Python\nPython is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python’s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language uses an object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Because it is a general-purpose language, there are packages available for doing data analysis tasks.\n\n\n\n9.3.2.1 Benefits\n\nMassive community\nIs a general-purpose programming language, so can be used for more than just data analysis\nHas a large number of packages for many different programming tasks\nIs more commonly used in the data science and machine learning community\nHas all necessary machine learning models available as packages\nBecause it is open source, it has more support with AI helper tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot\nOpen source, free to use, and easy to install\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.2 Drawbacks\n\nBecause it is a more formal and general-purpose programming language, it can be more difficult to learn for non-software engineers/developers\nNot as many statistical packages as R\nNot as easy to get started and setup when first making a project (need to create virtual environments)\nCommunity, and thus the packages available, take a more “set it up yourself” approach to common tasks, which can be a major barrier to entry for beginners\nThere are less beginner-friendly or -focused resources and learning material available\nStill not as widely used in the research environment, at least the Danish context, as Stata, so doesn’t have as much institutional support\nThere are few in-person courses that teach Python for data analysis, at least within the Danish context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 SAS\nSAS is a software suite developed by SAS Institute for advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, data management, and predictive analytics. It is used for data management, business intelligence, predictive analysis, and more.\n\n\n\n9.3.3.1 Benefits\n\nWidely used in certain industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, as well as some Danish research institutions like Denmark Statistics\nIs a very old language and so has many of the established statistical methods built-in\nAs it is a paid software, there is more personal support available\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3.2 Drawbacks\n\nIs closed source, so you need a license to install and use it, which makes it difficult to share and reproduce results\nWas designed in a different time period when software development practices were less advanced, so it’s language is less modern and more difficult to use\nNearly no new PhD student is familiar with SAS\nVery few courses teach SAS now\nBecause it is closed source, there is much less online and free resources for learning and using it\nBecause it is closed source, it has less support with AI helper tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot\nThe whole ecosystem is closed, which means learning all the features only available through SAS\nBecause it is closed source, it is more difficult to integrate with other tools and software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.4 Stata\nStata is a general-purpose statistical software package created by StataCorp. It is used by many researchers in the social sciences, public health, and economics.\n\n\n\n9.3.4.1 Benefits\n\nHas strong institutional support within Danish universities\nIs widely used in the research community, especially in the Danish context\nMany established researchers (in Denmark) are familiar with Stata\nHas many of the established statistical methods built-in\nWithin the Danish context, there are many courses at the university level that teach Stata\n\n\n\n\n9.3.4.2 Drawbacks\n\nHas all of the same drawbacks as SAS\nIn Denmark, fewer courses are teaching Stata compared to previous years",

However, because of tools that make it very easy to mix R and Python code together, for instance with Quarto, we also decide to use Python for some tasks where it is more appropriate, such as with machine learning analyses.\n\n9.4.1 Consequences\n\nStata has been used, supported, taught, and recommended at institutional levels in Danish universities for many years, many established researchers will be more familiar with Stata. Because of this, we may initially need to do more onboarding and training for those working on DP-Next\nFew people may be familiar with mixing Python and R, so may need to do more onboarding and training on this",

The focus is mainly on collaboration practices, tools, and methods that could benefit the project as a whole or multiple work packages. We discuss what went well, what didn’t go well, and what we can improve. Then we create action items to address the issues we identified.\n\n\n10.1.2 Update meetings\nEvery week we have a very short “update” meeting. We follow the style used in the Seedcase Project. Briefly, during the meeting, we screenshare the project board and go over the tasks on the board that are at the “in-progress” state or later (e.g. “in review”).

We also assign tasks to people on the board, which is shown on on the board itself to make it clear who is working on what.\nAll discussions happen on the GitHub issues, which are linked to the tasks on the board.
