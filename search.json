From both the technical and cultural sides, these work tasks often lack support at the institutional level and lack of awareness and training at the personnel level. So usually work is done from the ground-up, which often results in unexpected issues.\nGiven that there are few personnel in research environments with the necessary technical knowledge and skills and they often move out of academia into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we‚Äôve structured the groups to include at least one ‚Äútech lead‚Äù who is also part of the technical working group is to help minimise this challenge. We aim to provide training to these tech leads by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don‚Äôt work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we‚Äôve decided to establish the technical working group, so that we can minimise the impact these issues have on completing the project deliverables.",

For example, there are nearly no research software or data engineers within research groups or institutions, even though software and data are foundational components to conducting research in the modern era.\nTraditional management of larger scale research projects often involves setting up steering committees who check on progress through status updates and discuss solutions to issues that arise. However, there are many modern tools and methods used within industry that research environments and projects could benefit from, such as data engineering, software development, and operations management.\nLikewise, basic modern communication and project management tools are rarely, if ever, used within research environments, even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings. If these things are used by some groups, they are not shared nor advertised through traditional scientific publications, so if they exist, others can‚Äôt reuse and learn from each other to improve how we do research.",

    "text": "Specifics of the strategy\nExpanding on the strategies listed on the landing page, the below describes more of the details about the specific strategies from a technical or digital perspective. Specific activities and tasks are shown below in Figure¬†1. Many of these activities and strategies will get support and contributions from the Seedcase Project team at Steno Aarhus, who regularly use and refine many of these practices in their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Activities and tasks for Work Package 1.\n\n\n\n\nProject management\nWhile general project management and coordination will be done by the management group, the technical strategy for the project management will involve applying iterative and incremental methods often used in software development, such as Agile-inspired methods. Practically, this involves:\n\nUsing time-bound ‚Äúiterations‚Äù that has a specific aim to complete, where tasks are assigned that work toward completing this aim. This may involve having iterations be on a monthly basis.\nUsing a (digital) project board to track tasks, their status, who is assigned to what, with issues or discussions connected to each task.\nHaving regular ‚Äúreflection‚Äù meetings to identify things that work and things to improve on in our collaboration and management.\n\n\n\nCollaborative practices\nBuilding an effective collaboration between groups, centers, and people requires agreeing to a set of common practices that we all adhere to. In this way, we‚Äôll develop a description of basic standards and practices that we will discuss, refine, and agree on during the first year of the project. These documents will be living documents that we will post publicly on this website. Concretely, some practices may be:\n\nUsing a common set of tools for communication that works for everyone.\nUsing relevant communication channels dependent on the purpose, for example, extended discussions of a specific task should be done where the task is listed.\n\n\n\nResearch operations\nThe aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. This often integrates software engineering and data engineering work to accomplish the operational task. Concretely, this may include:\n\nAutomatically converting our documentation in easy to share and search websites.\nRegularly and actively seeking out areas of the research lifecycle that can be simplified, streamlined, or automated by incorporating dedicated meetings or reviews to uncover these areas to optimise. Then, based on this information, working to implement a solution.\nIdentifying and documenting the resources, limitations, and barriers on cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes to minimize their impact on the project.\n\n\n\nSoftware development\nResearch output includes more than just papers and presentations. It also includes analytic methods implemented as software packages. When work packages, such as Work Package 2, build or work on an analytic method, we will ensure that work with them to develop the software in a robust, well-designed, reliable, and maintainable way. Concretely, some activities may include:\n\nDeveloping a template for building the software package that includes best practices for software development.\n\n\n\nData engineering\nData engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and building data infrastructures and pipelines that support the collection and storage of high-quality data. Part of the aim of the Seedcase Project is in building software tools to help with creating and managing data and metadata in a way that applies FAIR principles and that simplifies the tasks that researchers have with requesting and working with the data. So the Seedcase team will be heavily involved in these tasks.\n\n\nTechnical working group\nTo help facilitate the technical and digital strategies so that they are achievable, we will establish a technical working group. More details about this group is found in the Groups page.\n\n\nTraining\nA major component of Work Package 1 is in training and upskilling activities. We will accomplish these by collaborating with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project (4) as well as with the expertise we‚Äôve developed at Steno Aarhus over the years. Training will include both formal and informal activities that focus on skills not often taught to researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices, and iterative project management methods.",

This group will, at a minimum, be composed of at least one person from each work package (and preferably in each Steno center to support our upskilling aims) who acts as a ‚Äútech lead‚Äù for that work package. This group will keep track of some day-to-day operations (‚Äúresearch operations‚Äù), identify ways to reduce technical barriers, improve on and support effective collaborative practices, as well as ensuring the research is reproducible and open."

In our case, the design patterns we will use are:\n\nOne Git or GitHub repository per scientific output\nThe pattern of ‚Äúone repo, one product‚Äù is a widely used pattern in many types of projects. There are many tools, templates, and workflows that are built around this pattern. For instance, it is easier to ensure a scientific document is reproducible if it follows this pattern. So administratively and collaboratively, it is easier to use a pattern like this, since it is a standardized way of structuring work. For DP-Next, this pattern includes the protocols as well as the scientific results.\nSome servers don‚Äôt allow internet or easy access to outside resources like GitHub. But all servers have Git installed. In those cases, each scientific output is one Git repository.",
