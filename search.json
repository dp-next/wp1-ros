    "text": "Academia lags far behind industry in many practical ways\nScience, while pursuing cutting edge knowledge, lags far behind industry in standard operational, organisational, and technological practices, tools, and methods. For example, there are nearly no research software or data engineers within research groups or institutions, even though software and data are foundational components to conducting research in the modern era.\nTraditional management of larger scale research projects often involves setting up steering committees who check on progress through status updates and discuss solutions to issues that arise. However, there are many modern tools and methods used within industry that research environments and projects could benefit from, such as data engineering, software development, and operations management.\nLikewise, basic modern communication and project management tools are rarely, if ever, used within research environments, even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings. If these things are used by some groups, they are not shared nor advertised through traditional scientific publications, so if they exist, others can‚Äôt reuse and learn from each other to improve how we do research.",

From both the technical and cultural sides, these work tasks often lack support at the institutional level and lack of awareness and training at the personnel level. So usually work is done from the ground-up, which often results in unexpected issues.\nGiven that there are few personnel in research environments with the necessary technical knowledge and skills and they often move out of academia into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we‚Äôve structured the groups to include at least one ‚Äútech lead‚Äù who is also part of the technical working group is to help minimise this challenge. We aim to provide training to these tech leads by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don‚Äôt work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration.

In this way, we‚Äôll develop a description of basic standards and practices that we will discuss, refine, and agree on during the first year of the project. These documents will be living documents that we will post publicly on this website. Concretely, some practices may be:\n\nUsing a common set of tools for communication that works for everyone.\nUsing relevant communication channels dependent on the purpose, for example, extended discussions of a specific task should be done where the task is listed.\n\n\n\nResearch operations\nThe aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. This often integrates software engineering and data engineering work to accomplish the operational task. Concretely, this may include:\n\nAutomatically converting our documentation in easy to share and search websites.\nRegularly and actively seeking out areas of the research lifecycle that can be simplified, streamlined, or automated by incorporating dedicated meetings or reviews to uncover these areas to optimise. Then, based on this information, working to implement a solution.\nIdentifying and documenting the resources, limitations, and barriers on cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes to minimize their impact on the project.\n\n\n\nSoftware development\nResearch output includes more than just papers and presentations. It also includes analytic methods implemented as software packages. When work packages, such as Work Package 2, build or work on an analytic method, we will ensure that work with them to develop the software in a robust, well-designed, reliable, and maintainable way. Concretely, some activities may include:\n\nDeveloping a template for building the software package that includes best practices for software development.\nContributing to data science activities by building reproducible analytic pipelines for faster dissemination of results.\n\n\n\nData engineering\nData engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and building data infrastructures and pipelines that support the collection and storage of high-quality data. Part of the aim of the Seedcase Project is in building software tools to help with creating and managing data and metadata in a way that applies FAIR principles and that simplifies the tasks that researchers have with requesting and working with the data. So the Seedcase team will be heavily involved in these tasks. Concretely, some activities may include:\n\nDeveloping a template for building data pipelines that includes best practices for data engineering.\nAutomating or streamlining data flows, from collected into stored, for rapid internal sharing of data outputs.\nStructuring and designing register data format conversion pipelines into more powerful and modern formats.\nDesigning and building data generated into a functioning and FAIR ‚Äúdata package‚Äù.\n\n\n\nKnowledge management\nKnowledge management is the practice of capturing, storing, and sharing knowledge across an organisation or group. In the context of this project, we will focus on capturing and sharing knowledge about the project, the knowledge we produce, as well as any research output that we have. We ‚Äúcapture‚Äù knowledge largely by using GitHub to write, share, and discuss things, either as issues, comments, or files. Knowledge includes:\n\nInformation about the project, the research, and the tools and practices that we use.\nStudy protocols that are the description of the research question, the methods used to answer the question, and the data that will be collected.\nData management plans, which are the description of how data will be collected, stored, and shared.\nStatistical analysis plans, which are the description of how the data will be analysed.\nOperational documents, like decisions made, procedures, collaboration agreements, and workflows for collaboration and work.\n\n\n\nTechnical working group\nTo help facilitate the technical and digital strategies so that they are achievable, we will establish a technical working group. More details about this group is found in the Groups page.\n\n\nTraining\nA major component of Work Package 1 is in training and upskilling activities. We will accomplish these by collaborating with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project (4) as well as with the expertise we‚Äôve developed at Steno Aarhus over the years. Training will include both formal and informal activities that focus on skills not often taught to researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices, and iterative project management methods.",

We discuss what went well, what didn‚Äôt go well, and what we can improve. Then we create action items to address the issues we identified.\n\n\nUpdate meetings\nEvery week we have a very short ‚Äúupdate‚Äù meeting. We follow the style used in the Seedcase Project.

    "text": "Project management and task tracking\nEvery task that each person is working on is created on, tracked, and visible on the GitHub Project board. The board is divided into columns that represent the state of the task (e.g.¬†‚Äúto do‚Äù, ‚Äúin progress‚Äù, ‚Äúin review‚Äù, ‚Äúdone‚Äù). The board is used to track the progress of the project and to identify bottlenecks or issues that need to be addressed, reviewed, or discussed. We also assign tasks to people on the board, which is shown on on the board itself to make it clear who is working on what.\nAll discussions happen on the GitHub issues, which are linked to the tasks on the board. These discussions are comments to the Issue, that way we keep all the information about a task in one place and so that others can participate in the discussion as well.",
