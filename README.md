# Work Package 1: Better research done in less time

The main part of this work package involves incorporating reproducible
and open science practices into the workflow and output of the DP-Next
project. A secondary part of this work package is to develop a set of
tools and practices that will help the project achieve its goals in a
more efficient manner through the use of research operations, iterative
project management, and a digital infrastructure that supports the
research. Hopefully that will translate into more effective
collaboration, communication, coordination, and development of the
project.

We integrate and make heavy use of the work done in the [Seedcase
Project](https://seedcase-project.org).
