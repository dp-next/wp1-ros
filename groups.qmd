### Management group

The project will be led by the principal investigator, with support from
the co-applicants / Work Package leaders, who together form the
management group. This group will be responsible for the overall
coordination of the project and ensuring it's successful completion.

### Technical working group

The technical working group will be responsible for the more technical
and practical aspects of the project, primarily being responsible for
fulfilling the aims of Work Package 1. This group will, at a minimum, be
composed of at least one person from each work package (and preferably
in each Steno center to support our upskilling aims) who acts as a "tech
lead" for that work package. This group will keep track of some
day-to-day operations ("research operations"), identify ways to reduce
technical barriers, improve on and support effective collaborative
practices, as well as ensuring the research is reproducible and open.
