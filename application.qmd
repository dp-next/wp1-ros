## First round

-   **Characters**: 644

WP1 answers the increasing need for openness, transparency, and
reproducibility in research, will deliver the day-to-day project and
operations management of all the WPs and will facilitate close
collaboration and joint expertise development across all Steno Centres.

Effective coordination and management of complex projects such as
DP-Next requires modern and innovative approaches to project and
operational management. We will employ tools developed and tested at
SDCA in the past years [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github] to offer a practical framework for sharing knowledge and
technical skills across centres, aiming to deliver "better research done
in less time" [@Lowndes2017].

## Second round

-   **Characters**: 2200 / 1800 characters

Science, while pursuing cutting edge knowledge, lags behind industry in
standard operational, organisational, and technological practices,
tools, and methods. From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better
research in less time [@Lowndes2017] and expand the capacity of modern
technical engineering-based skills in research groups across Steno and
Denmark. By applying modern operational, engineering, and project
management practices, we will optimize work done across the WPs. Through
formal and informal upskilling sessions, we will develop data
engineering and modern collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers
from across the Steno Centers.

At SDCA, we have been developing and applying these practices in
multiple projects [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github], which highlight tangible examples of WP1's activities.
The general strategy for WP1 is to: 1) develop and agree on some basic
principles for collaboration between centers and WPs that adhere to open
scientific practices and modern collaborative methods; 2) investigate
potential barriers to effective cross-Steno collaboration; 3) decide on
a set of common tools and standards to use across centers for WP.
Specific actions and tasks are found in @fig-gantt-wp1 and @fig-actions.

Aside from the traditional management group overseeing the project, we
will also have a research operations group that will simplify,
streamline, and automate the collaboration and coordination of
activities and products between WPs and centers as well as provide a
space for learning these technical skills. See @fig-organization and the
collaboration section below for more details, as well as @fig-gantt for
the general project timeline.

A major component of WP1 is also upskilling activities, in collaboration
with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project
[@seedcase]. Training will focus on skills not often taught to
researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices,
and iterative project management methods.

More detail on this WP can be found on the DP-Next website
(https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dp-next/wp1/), such as the roadmap,
potential challenges, and strategy.
