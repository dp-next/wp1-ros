title: "Strategy"
description: Strategic principles and actions taken in Work Package 1.
---

We've structured and organised Work Package 1 based on the
increasing need for openness, transparency, and reproducibility in
research. Work Package 1 will deliver the day-to-day project and operations
management of all the work packages, as well as facilitating the close
collaboration and joint development of expertise across all seven Steno
Centers.

To achieve effective and optimal coordination and management of
a complex project like this, we will employ resources and
tools developed and tested at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus in the past years [@Johnston2022;
@DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase; @sdca-github] to offer a practical
framework for sharing knowledge and technical skills across centres,
which will deliver "better research done in less time" [@Lowndes2017]
while following reproducible and open scientific practices.

## Guiding principles

One of the initial steps in the strategy involves developing and
implementing general principles that will guide collaboration and work
across the Steno Centers. This ensures we have a basis for following a
common approach to working and communicating together when managing the
work packages. While we will finalise and refine the principles during the first
year of the project, below are some principles that will form the basis
for all other principles.

-   Assume openness with as many things as possible, including
    communication
-   Implement openness as much as possible, excluding personal and
    sensitive data
-   Disseminate as many steps of the research lifecycle as possible,
    including non-traditional outputs (e.g. protocols or standard
    operating procedures)
-   Implement as much as possible explicit analyses and data
    processing/management using code-based and programmatic
    pipeline/workflow management

## Specifics of the strategy

Expanding on the strategies listed on the [landing page](index.qmd),
the below describes more of the details about the specific strategies from a technical or digital perspective.
Specific actions and tasks are found in a later section, as well as in @fig-actions.

### Project management

While general project management and coordination will be done by the
management [group](groups.qmd), the technical strategy for the project
management will involve applying iterative and incremental methods
often used in software development, such as Agile-inspired methods. In
particular, this involves using a (digital) board to track tasks and
using regular "reflection" meetings to identify things that work
and things to improve on in our collaboration and management. The
Seedcase Project team at Steno Aarhus uses these practices with
very good results.

### Collaborative practices

Building an effective collaboration between groups, centers, and people
requires agreeing to a set of common practices that we all adhere to.
In this way, we'll develop a description of basic standards and practices
that we will discuss, refine, and agree on during the first year of the project.
These documents will be living documents that we will post publicly on
this website.

## Research operations

The aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order
to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output.

we will apply modern and innovative methods
in project and operational management practices,


Investigate and identify resources, limitations, and barriers on
cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes.

## Software development

will simplify,
streamline, and automate the collaboration and coordination of
activities and products between WPs and centers as well as provide a
space for learning these technical skills.

- Regularly seek to identify and implement ways to simplify, streamline,
and automate activities throughout the research life cycle of DP-Next and
the other Work Packages.

## Data engineering

## Technical working group

-   Establish an overall management group and a research operations
    group of relevant persons from each center to track progress,
    coordinate tasks, and manage the project.


## Upskilling

A major component of WP1 is also upskilling activities, in collaboration
with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project
[@seedcase]. Training will focus on skills not often taught to
researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices,
and iterative project management methods.

Through
formal and informal upskilling sessions, we will develop data
engineering and modern collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers
from across the Steno Centers.

## Actions

Some of
the initial tasks revolve around establishing:

- A communications channel
for everyone (as well as sub-channels for individual WPs and groups)
that make it easy to keep everyone updated and to view all
communications done (not emails).
- A project management platform visible
and usable by everyone.
- An effective project management approach that
groups can use to track tasks and deliverables (e.g. a suitable approach
might be using Kanban principles)
- A document sharing platform,
ensuring that all of these also follow the guiding principles.

Later
tasks include developing the deliverables of the WPs in a way that makes
sharing and interoperability easier, both internal to the project groups
and WPs as well as to external stakeholders.

## Potential tools and methods to use

The exact tools and methods that will be used will first need to be
decided upon by everyone. However, some of the tools and methods that we
are considering that follow the principles include:

-   R for programming, data processing, and analysis
-   GitHub to use as the knowledge and document repository
-   Quarto (next generation of R Markdown) for writing and sharing
    documents, as well as creating websites
-   Discord for central communication
-   Teamup for central calendar and scheduling
-   Agile-inspired iterative and incremental methods for project management
-   GitHub Projects for project management
-   Seedcase software for data infrastructure, management and sharing

## Potential barriers and challenges

Aside from the standard project management tasks, implementing modern
research ops and collaborative practices that support conducting open
and reproducible science across all Steno Centers will be a challenge.
Given that there are few personnel in research environments with the necessary
technical knowledge and skills and they often move out of academia
into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be
spent in training and upskilling existing personnel.

The reason we’ve
structured the groups to include at least one “tech lead” who is also
part of the research ops group is to help minimise this challenge. We
aim to provide training to this tech lead by embedding them in some of
the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing
many of these practices.

Another major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT
systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed
for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we've decided to
establish the technical working group, so that we can minimise the impact these
issues have on completing the project deliverables.
