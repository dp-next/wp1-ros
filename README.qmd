This is work package 1 of the [DP-Next
project](https://dp-next.github.io/). The main part of this work package
1 involves incorporating reproducible and open science practices into
the workflow and output of the DP-Next project. A secondary part of this
work package is to develop a set of tools and practices that will help
the project achieve its goals in a more efficient manner through the use
of research operations, iterative project management, and a digital
infrastructure that supports the research. Hopefully that will translate
into more effective collaboration, communication, coordination, and
development of the project.
