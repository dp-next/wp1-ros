This document covers the basic, overall plan for DP-Next as well as the
plan for WP1. While the Gantt charts display an overview of the project,
the sections below on milestones and deliverables provide more detailed
information than what can be put on the charts.

## Milestones

-   Setup project websites to host details and documents relevant to this
    project and it's WPs

-   Setup website to document and describe research operational
    practices used across Centers for easier sharing and onboarding

-   Open-source template Data Management Plan to use for WP3

-   Setup research data infrastructure that supports adhering to open
    FAIR practices for ease of internal and external sharing of data for
    WP3 (using software built from NNF-funded project from SDCA called
    Seedcase: https://seedcase-project.org/)

-   Open-source templates for building software package/app for risk
    prediction engine from WP2
