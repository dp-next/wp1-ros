title: "Better research in less time and fewer resources"

::: column-page
## Visions

-   Better research done in less time and with fewer resources

-   Reproducibility and openness in research

-   Researchers with modern technical engineering-based and project
    management skills embedded in more research groups

-   Modern data engineering practices and research operational
    approaches established as a standard of practice when conducting
    research

## Strategies

-   Create management groups to manage and coordinate centers and work
    packages in completing their deliverables.

-   Develop and implement cross-Steno *Research Operations* and modern
    collaborative workflows and practices that support the successful
    completion of each work package as well as improving research
    practices across Steno centers.

-   Optimise and reduce the time and effort spent between designing the
    work package studies and the final dissemination of high-quality
    research results.

-   Incorporate reproducible and open science practices into the
    research workflow to both improve the quality of research and reduce
    the time spent on data processing, analysis, and dissemination.

-   Build up inter- and intra-Steno knowledge and skill capacity
    ("upskill") in non-traditional technical skills and knowledge such
    as software development, data engineering, operational management
    (including "DataOps"), and iterative project management practices.
