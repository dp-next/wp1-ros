## Visions

-   Better, reproducible, and open research done in less time and
    with fewer resources

-   Researchers with modern technical engineering-based and project
    management skills embedded in more research groups

-   Modern data engineering practices and research operational
    approaches established as a standard of practice when conducting
    research

## Strategies

-   Create management groups to manage and coordinate centers and work
    packages in completing their deliverables.

-   Develop and implement cross-Steno *Research Operations* and modern
    collaborative workflows and practices that support the successful
    completion of each work package as well as improving research
    practices across Steno centers.

-   Optimise and reduce the time and effort spent between designing the
    work package studies and the final dissemination of high-quality
    research results.

-   Incorporate reproducible and open science practices into the
    research workflow to both improve the quality of research and reduce
    the time spent on data processing, analysis, and dissemination.

-   Build up inter- and intra-Steno knowledge and skill capacity
    ("upskill") in non-traditional technical skills and knowledge such
    as software development, data engineering, operational management
    (including "DataOps"), and iterative project management practices.

## Sciences lags behind in many practical and technical aspects

Science, while generating cutting-edge knowledge, lags behind most
industry settings when it comes to practical, operational aspects. For
example, while much of research done now relies heavily on software and
computational work, funding agencies rarely fund software and data
engineering projects, nor do many research groups hire these highly
skilled technical personnel.

We hope, through Work Package 1, to establish these skills and needs as
a core component of the DP-Next project and to help do "better research
in less time".

## A core strategy is to establish a "technical" working group

By having a dedicated working group that works to fulfil the aims of
this work package, we hope to emphasize the importance of these
practices and to ensure they are implemented across all work packages.
All groups will include a "tech lead" who has technical knowledge and
skills and who will be a part of this technical working group, to help
coordinate work package groups with these practices.

We aim to onboard and train the tech leads in these practices by
embedding them in some work done at SDCA, where these practices have
been developing and refining over the last several years.

## Plenty of risks and challenges

The two biggest challenges we face with Work Package 1 are:

1.  The need for highly technical personnel who have sufficient
    fundamental expertise to understand and apply these practices, which
    we hope to minimise through the training and onboarding of the tech
    leads.
2.  The IT systems across centers that often donâ€™t work well together,
    which we hope to reduce the impact of by having a dedicated research
    operations group.

## We aren't just support, we are a core component of research

While Work Package 1 forms the foundation to all work packages of
DP-Next, and in many ways aims to support their success, our activities
are an increasingly needed aspect of research throughout the world.

So, aside from completing the responsibilities and tasks we have for
DP-Next, we also aim to produce tangible and usable deliverables that
are independent and valuable on their own.
